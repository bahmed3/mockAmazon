# Mock Amazon
The goal of this project was to replicate the functionality and layout of an e-commerce site like Amazon, focusing on displaying products and allowing users to add items to a shopping cart. This was developed as part of a guided learning journey into the world of web development by SuperSimpleDev, with the intention to apply and strengthen my understanding of JavaScript and version control using Git.

## Objective 
The objective of this project was to replicate the structure and design of a YouTube page to enhance my understanding of how HTML and CSS can be used to create complex layouts.

## Technologies 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Git

## Strategy
Here are the key strategies I employed:

### HTML
- **Semantic HTML:** The code structure was made clear and easy to understand using semantic HTML tags.
- **Input and Buttons:** The application allowed users to interact with the page by selecting quantities and adding items to a shopping cart.

### CSS
- **Grid Layout:** The CSS grid layout was used to align the products on the page in a flexible and aesthetically pleasing manner.
- **Styling:** Specific styles were created for different elements on the page to improve the overall user experience.

### JavaScript
- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript was used to dynamically generate HTML for each product, resulting in a flexible codebase.
- **Event Listeners:** Interactivity was added using JavaScript event listeners, allowing users to add items to a shopping cart.
- **Data Structures:** An array was used to manage the items in the cart, demonstrating basic understanding of JavaScript data structures and manipulation.

### Git
**Version Control:** I used Git for version control, allowing me to track changes, revert to previous states, and create branches for experimenting with new features.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I've learned a lot about how to use JavaScript to dynamically create and manipulate HTML elements, how to handle user interactions using event listeners, and how to manage data in an application. I was introduced to Git for version control. This allowed me to view changes made in the code, track them over time, and commit those changes. This experience provided me with an understanding of the importance of version control in a developer's workflow, and set the foundation for more advanced Git operations in the future. The project also taught me how to work with more complex layouts and apply different CSS styles based on different states of the application.

## Future Work
This is a guided project, there is more functionality and interactivity to be added on as the lessons progress. I will regularly follow and update it to strengthen my skills of JavaScript, to help me become a better software engineer and web developer.
